Ideas Explored and Rejected (EARs):

* Prop	Internalize Rule fields to prevent implicit zero-value initializations

	Rejected on 2025-08-06

	Since the Rule type is a struct with exported fields,
	it can unintentionally be initialized with implicit
	zero-values. While introducing a Require function to
	explicitly create a Rule would be an improvement, a
	more effective solution is to eliminate all structs
	entirely. The simplest alternative is to directly
	parameterize the required fields into the Check 
	function and invoke it multiple times for the same key
	(field string) when necessary.
